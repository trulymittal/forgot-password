# Password Reset one-time link login.

This is a simple repo which contains the logic for sending one-time password reset links valid for 15 minutes (though time can be changed in code).

This repo does NOT use any email sending API or any Database, the user is hard-coded and the link is only logged in console. That is for you to implement. This ONLY contains the logic.
